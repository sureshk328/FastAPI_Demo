Criminals fascinates me as they have distorted psychology and their view about the world is dysfunctional that normal people have difficulty grasping their reasoning.,1
I think most criminals are just trying to survive as they don't have same opportunities as others. They just want to escape from their hellish conditions.,1

Every crime has different intensity and we as a society should judge criminals according to the crime they had committed and provide them a chance to get back to the society and stand on their feet but only to the ones who deserves that.,2
Most criminals commit dozens of crimes weekly and they doesn't get caught or even questioned or suspected by the police and they continue to do more heinous crimes so these people should be stopped or punished at the initial point.,2

"Criminals are not born but created. Sometimes by the poverty, by society or by the government itself.",2
It is not mandatory that only criminals commit crimes even other classes of society commit crimes but no one realises that or can not take actions against them. So we should not separate criminals from the normal people.,1
I think there is only one way to make crime come to an end and that is by making criminals pay for their crimes so that they may never try to commit crimes again.,3
There is no explanation for crime as some people does that only for curiosity.,3
Crime is also a form of addiction and once a criminal always a criminal.,3

Sometimes laws also play their role in making criminals by convicting heavily a person for his mistakes which can be forgiven.,0
Every person has a good as well as bad side and showing your bad side to the world doesn't have any explanation. You can not punish the society for your sufferings,2
Criminals think very differently from the law abiding that's why it's difficult to understand them.,1
Criminals became a lost cause that couldn't be restored back to humanity and this is not completely the person's fault.,2
